# What is Fizz Buzz?
According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz), Fizz Buzz is a group word game for children to teach them about division.

Players generally sit in a circle. The player designated to go first says the number "1", and the players then count upwards in turn. However, any number divisible by three is replaced by the word "fizz" and any number divisible by five by the word "buzz". Numbers divisible by both three and five (i.e. divisible by 15) become "fizz buzz".

A player who hesitates or makes a mistake is eliminated.

## The Coding Challenge
I took a lesson on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-problem-solving) that involved learning problem-solving skills by solving the following problem:

>Write a program that takes a userâ€™s input and prints the numbers from one to the number the user entered. However, for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.
